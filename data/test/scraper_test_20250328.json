    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models associate vision and text to\nlabel pixels from an undefined set of classes using textual queries, providing\nversatile performance on novel datasets. However, large shifts between training\nand test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective\nreal-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a\nnovel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages\na library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically\nmerging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in\nthe embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each\nspecific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently,\nenhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently\nprotects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications.\nComprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard\ndatasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across\ndiverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for\nopen-vocabulary semantic segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) reconstruction is crucial for\ncapturing dynamic anatomical changes but faces inherent limitations from\nconventional phase-binning workflows. Current methods discretize temporal\nresolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing\nmotion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We\npropose X$^2$-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT\nreconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with\nself-supervised respiratory motion learning. Our approach models anatomical\ndynamics through a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture that predicts\ntime-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. To remove\ndependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven\nperiodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles\ndirectly from projections via differentiable optimization.

    "abstract": "It is one of the most fundamental objectives in quantum information science\nto understand the boundary between the computational power of classical and\nquantum computers. One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify\nclasses of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical\ncomputer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical\ndevice, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device\nthat is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study\nhow the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such\ntechnique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the\nresult of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces\ncircuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum\ndevice.\n  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of\nnonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical\nside, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple\nsmaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit\nknitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the\nresource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation\noverhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels\nand we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate\nthe utility of classical communication between the local parties. Our results\naddress both the single-shot and asymptotic regime.\n  We frame QPS in a quantum resource theoretic framework, which highlights\nsimilarities that arise in the different instantiations of the technique.\nFurthermore, we study the importance of classical side information in the QPS\nprocedure and how it impacts the overhead and expressibility of QPS.",

It is as yet unclear, when populations respond to these selective pressures, the extent to which this results in convergent genetic evolution and whether convergence is due to independent mutations or shared ancestral variation. We address these questions using a classic example of adaptation by natural selection by investigating the rapid colonization of the plant species Mimulus guttatus to copper contaminated soils. We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance locus, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment. We assemble the genome of a mine adapted genotype and identify regions of this genome in tight genetic linkage to Tol1. We discover a set of a multicopper oxidase genes that are genetically linked to Tol1 and exhibit large differences in expression between tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes. We overexpressed this gene in M. guttatus and A. thaliana and found the introduced gene contributes to enhanced copper tolerance. We identify convergent adaptation loci that are additional to Tol1 by measuring genome-wide differences in allele frequency between pairs of mine and off-mine populations and narrow these regions to specific candidate genes using differences in protein sequence and gene expression. Furthermore, patterns of genetic variation at the two most differentiated candidate loci are consistent with selection acting upon alleles that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. These results suggest that adaptation to the mine habitat occurred via selection on ancestral variation, rather than independent de novo mutations or migration between populations.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined whether a cognitive process model that is inferred based on group data holds, and is meaningful, at the level of the individual person. Investigation of this issue is tantamount to questioning that the same set and configuration of cognitive processes is present within all individuals, a usually untested assumption in standard group-based experiments. Search from memory as assessed with the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm is among the most widely studied phenomena in cognitive psychology. According to the original memory scanning model, search is serial and exhaustive. Here we critically examined the validity of this model across individuals and practice. 32 younger adults completed 1488 trials of the Sternberg task distributed over eight sessions. In the first session, group data followed the pattern predicted by the original model, replicating earlier findings. However, data from the first session were not sufficiently reliable for identifying whether each individual complied with the serial exhaustive search model. In sessions six to eight, when participants performed near asymptotic levels of performance, between-person differences were reliable, group data deviated substantially from the original memory search model, and the model fit only 13 of the 32 participants data. Our findings challenge the proposition that one general memory search process exists within a group of healthy younger adults, and questions the testability of this proposition at the individual level in single-session experiments. Implications for cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience are discussed with reference to earlier work emphasizing the explicit consideration of potentially existent individual differences.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of rod-shape in bacterial cells depends on the actin-like protein MreB. Deletion of mreB from Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 results in viable spherical cells of variable volume and reduced fitness. Using a combination of time-resolved microscopy and biochemical assay of peptidoglycan synthesis, we show that reduced fitness is a consequence of perturbed cell size homeostasis that arises primarily from differential growth of daughter cells. A 1,000-generation selection experiment resulted in rapid restoration of fitness with derived cells retaining spherical shape. Mutations in the peptidoglycan synthesis protein Pbp1A were identified as the main route for evolutionary rescue with genetic reconstructions demonstrating causality. Compensatory pbp1A mutations that targeted transpeptidase activity enhanced homogeneity of cell wall synthesis on lateral surfaces and restored cell size homeostasis. Mechanistic explanations require enhanced understanding of why deletion of mreB causes heterogeneity in cell wall synthesis. We conclude by presenting two testable hypotheses, one of which posits that heterogeneity stems from non-functional cell wall synthesis machinery, while the second posits that the machinery is functional, albeit stalled. Overall, our data provide support for the second hypothesis and draw attention to the importance of balance between transpeptidase and glycosyltransferase functions of peptidoglycan building enzymes for cell shape determination.",

    "abstract": "While cis peptides preceding proline can occur about 5% of the time, cis peptides preceding any other residue (\"cis-nonPro\" peptides) are an extremely rare feature in protein structures, of considerable importance for two opposite reasons. On one hand, their genuine occurrences are mostly found at sites critical to biological function, from the active sites of carbohydrate enzymes to rare adjacent-residue disulfide bonds. On the other hand, a cis-nonPro can easily be misfit into weak or ambiguous electron density, which led to a high incidence of unjustified cis-nonPro over the 2006-2015 decade. This paper uses high-resolution crystallographic data and especially stringent quality-filtering at the residue level to identify genuine occurrences of cis-nonPro, and to survey both individual examples and broad patterns of their functionality.\n\nWe explain the procedure developed to identify genuine cis-nonPro examples with almost no false positives. We then survey a large sample of the varied functional roles and structural contexts of cis-nonPro, including the uses of specific amino acids for particular purposes. We emphasize aspects not previously covered: that cis-nonPro always (except for vicinal disulfides) occur in highly ordered structure, and especially the great concentration of occurrence in proteins that process or bind carbohydrates (identified by occurrence on the CAZy website).",

    "abstract": "Proteasomes are abundant molecular machines distributed throughout the eukaryotic cell to facilitate protein degradation. We previously showed that proteasomes can re-organize and assemble into foci bodies in response to proteotoxic stress1, which we termed transient aggregate-associated droplets (TAADs)2. Here, we use single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify re-organization of mammalian proteasomes in different subcellular regions during proteotoxic stress to engage with invading protein aggregates. We determine that [~]60% of 20S proteasomes are capped by at least one 19S particle, and this ratio remains constant during stress. Using single-particle tracking, we show that cells confine global proteasomal movement when experiencing proteotoxic stress via a cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism. Similar limitations on proteasome movement are also observed upon membrane depolarization and repolarization events by patch clamp, which directly induce proteasomes to move away or towards the plasma membrane, respectively. Together, our experiments reveal distinct modes of proteasome motion dependent on cellular requirements, and propose that proteasome transport is restricted upon aggregate invasion to facilitate their subsequent degradation.",

    "authors": "Van Pelt, J.; Lowe, B. G.; Robinson, J. E.; Donaldson, M. J.; Johnston, P.; Yamamoto, N.",
    "abstract": "Onset primacy is a behavioural phenomenon whereby humans identify the appearance of an object (onset) with greater efficiency than other kinds of visual change, such as the disappearance of an object (offset). The default mode hypothesis explains this phenomenon by postulating that the attentional system is optimised for onset detection in its initial state. The present study extended this hypothesis by combining a change detection task and measurement of the P300 event-related potential, which was thought to index the amount of processing resources available to detecting onsets and offsets. In an experiment, while brain activity was monitored by electroencephalography, participants indicated the locations of onsets and offsets under the condition in which they occurred equally often in the same locations across trials. Although there was no reason to prioritise detecting one type of change over the other, onsets were detected more quickly and they evoked a larger P300 than offsets. These results suggest that processing resources are preferentially allocated to onset detection. This biased allocation may be a basis on which the attentional system defaults to the  onset detection mode.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis sortase-assembled endocarditis and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp) are a virulence factor implicated in enterococcal biofilm-associated infections and gastrointestinal colonization. We previously showed that E. faecalis biofilm metabolism is influenced by extracellular electron transfer (EET) under iron-rich conditions, raising the question of whether Ebp pili also play a role in EET. Here, we report a novel role of Ebp pili in E. faecalis adhesion to the iron oxides magnetite, goethite and hematite, where the EbpA tip adhesin contributes to this interaction. Adhesion by Ebp pili is conditionally important for EET to iron oxides, as pilus mutants are attenuated in EET under non-static growth conditions. In alignment with the established role of EET in redox homeostasis, we find that EET to ferricyanide supports E. faecalis anaerobic growth on glycerol. Further, in an antibiotic-treated mouse gastrointestinal colonization model, we show that E. faecalis mutants deficient in EET poorly colonize the intestinal niche. Taken together, our findings suggest that Ebp pili can influence E. faecalis metabolic fitness by promoting EET to iron oxides, raising new questions of how Ebp pili shape E. faecalis interactions with environmental ecosystems. Furthermore, the important role of EET in E. faecalis colonization of the dysbiotic gastrointestinal environment highlights the need for further inquiry into how EET contributes to E. faecalis microbial pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceIn this study, we explored the interplay between extracellular electron transfer (EET) and an Enterococcus faecalis biofilm factor, the endocarditis and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp). We demonstrate that Ebp pili have a novel role in adhesion to iron oxides, which consequently promotes EET to iron oxides under non-static conditions. Along with our findings that E. faecalis EET can be coupled to anaerobic cell growth, our results point to a potential ecological role of Ebp pili in natural environments, outside of its established function in adhesion to host ligands. We provide the first evidence of the contribution of EET to E. faecalis colonization of the antibiotic-treated murine intestinal niche, which adds to the limited experimental evidence linking EET and microbial pathogenesis, as well as highlights the need for further studies of EET in bacterial pathogens.",
